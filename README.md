ðŸ“¦ About This Project
This repository contains a code piece I've been working on to showcase my backend development skills. It's designed to highlight my experience with Symfony, Hexagonal Architecture, microservices, and other technologies I commonly use in real-world projects.

The goal is to provide a glimpse into my coding style, architecture decisions, and technical approach â€” especially in contexts where quality, scalability, and maintainability are essential.

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions or suggestions!
